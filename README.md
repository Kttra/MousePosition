# MousePosition
Two programs that gives us the coordinate position of the mouse. Created using C# and .NET. The MousePosition program simply just gives us the position of the mouse. On the other hand, the MouseSetPos program gives us the position and allows us to move the mouse to a set coordinate (we use the mousekeyhook package in order to achieve this).

**Purpose**
-----------------
While these two programs are simple in nature, they allow for us to build powerful applications. One such application that I have created is the [ratio calculator](https://github.com/Kttra/RatioCalculator) program. I utilize the mouse position in order to draw a rectangle over a region with the mouse and then calculate the length and width of the selected region. By doing so, we get the ratio of the region.
